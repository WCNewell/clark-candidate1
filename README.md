# Clark Newell Personal Web App

## Based on gatsby-starter-dimension-v2

This is a Gatsby.js V2 starter based on the Dimension template, designed by HTML5 UP.

GatsbyJS is a super fast static site generator featuring React, Webpack, GraphQL, and modern JavaScript CSS. GatsbyJS helps you build progressive web apps using the JAMstack.

Designs from HTML 5 UP feature gorgeous Sass. Check out https://codebushi.com/gatsby-starters/ for more Gatsby starters and templates.

For my first personal web app, I am pleased that I could quickly adapt the code to my current styling and content needs.

Through this portfolio site you can read my profile, link to other projects/repos on GitHub, connect with me via LinkedIn or Twitter social media links or reach out to me via the contact form.

In future iterations, I am planning to tap into the really great data query and blog functionality that GastbyJS offers using GraphQL.
