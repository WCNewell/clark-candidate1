# Clark Newell Personal Web App

## Based on gatsby-starter-dimension-v2

This is a Gatsby.js V2 starter based on the Dimension site template, designed by HTML5 UP.

GatsbyJS is a super fast static site generator featuring React, Webpack, GraphQL, and modern JavaScript CSS.

Designs from HTML 5 UP feature aboslutely gorgeous Sass. Check out https://codebushi.com/gatsby-starters/ for more Gatsby starters and templates.

My first personal web app, I am pleased that I could so quickly adapt the code to my current styling and content needs.

In future iterations, I would love to tap into the great blogging functionality that GastbyJS offers using GraphQL.
