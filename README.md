# Clark Newell Personal Web App

## Based on gatsby-starter-dimension-v2

This is a Gatsby.js V2 starter based on the Dimension template from by HTML5 UP.

GatsbyJS is a super fast static site generator built on the "JAMstack" featuring React, Webpack, GraphQL, and modern JavaScript CSS/Sass.

For my first personal web app, I am pleased that I could quickly adapt the code to my current styling and content needs.

Through this portfolio site you can read my profile, link to other projects/repos on GitHub, connect with me via LinkedIn or Twitter social media links or reach out to me via the contact form.

In the next iteration, I am tapping into the really great data query and blog functionality that GastbyJS offers using GraphQL.
