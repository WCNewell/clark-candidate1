# Clark Newell Personal Web App

>https://clarknewell.tech

This is a Gatsby.js V2 starter based on the Dimension template from by HTML5 UP.

GatsbyJS is a super fast static site generator built on the "JAMstack" featuring React, Webpack, GraphQL, and modern JavaScript CSS/Sass.

For my first personal web app, I adapted the code to my current styling and content needs.

Through this portfolio site you can read my profile, link to other projects/repos on GitHub, connect with me via LinkedIn or Twitter social media links or reach out to me via the contact form.

This site also features a unique logo that I designed as well as original photography all meant to represent my passion for the outdoors, artistic aesthetic, and desire to achieve optimal health and positivity.

In the next iteration, I am tapping into the really great data query and blog functionality that GastbyJS offers using GraphQL.

This site is hosted by Bluehost, where my personal domain and email address is also registered (this is before I learned about other options available with services such as Netlify and Contentful). Nonetheless, Bluehost does offer very friendly customer service, which I found out after making a newb move and totally obliterating my entire file manager panel. Bluehost is actually very WordPress orietented, which I didn't realize at the time of purchase, but this may come in handy as I am currently planning to implement a headless WordPress for my blog CMS.
